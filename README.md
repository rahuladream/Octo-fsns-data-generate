Generating the dataset for fsns (attention ocr) Deep Networks, End-to-end Networks, Image Dataset, Multiview Dataset

Google officials did not say in this part carefully, only to a stackoverflow link, but This link is also not clear,and have some mistakes, so I wrote a code to generate FSNS format (JPG / PNG) tfrecord .

## about FSNS

FSNS dataset is a set of signs, from the streets of France, that bear street names. Some example images are shown in Figure 1. Each image carries four tiles of 150 Ã— 150 pixels laid out horizontally, each of which contains a pre-detected street name sign, or random noise in the case that less than four independent views are available of the same physical sign
